This is a list of things that needs to be done to propagate the changes properly.
Write DONE to each issue once resolved.

TeX Distributions:
- [DONE] propagate changes into TeX Live
- [DONE] coordinate with Christian Schenk <cs at miktex.org> for changes in MikTeX
- [DONE] coordinate with Akira Kakuto <kakuto at fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp> for changes in W32TeX

Pattern creators:
- make a list of pattern authors, notify them about changes,
  explain them that they need to modify UTF-8 file/submit file it as UTF-8 in future
- write DONE for each language once you receive the answer from the author

Languages:
- complete languages.html
- unification of Mongolian
  - encoding
  - pattern versions
    - [DONE] a list of differences received from Dorjgotov Batmunkh <bataak at gmail.com>
    - add that list to repository
    - waiting for answer from Oliver Corff <corff at zedat.fu-berlin.de>
- unification of Spanish (some new version of patterns submitted)
- join Serbian patterns & describe differences between sh-cyrl and sr-cyrl
- [DONE] do something with EO: I did the conversion for "plain" patterns, but left the original version intact
  we could leave a separate version in "source" and use the "plain version" in pattern repository
- Russian etc. that are still outsourcing
  - solve encoding mess
- versioning: German etc.
- Norwegian
- Add Indic scripts & auto-updater

CTAN:
- move old patterns to obsolete
- [DONE] upload new patterns
- make an easy-to-browse structure
- ask CTAN people to be careful if someone uploads new patterns
- write auto-notificator for changes in CTAN

OpenOffice:
- write auto-notificator for changes in OOo (more important)
- contact the authors & join the efforts
- import indic scripts

Impromevents:
- prepare a better version of notes
- auto-conversion into four different files:
  - licence
  - list of used letters for each language (lowercase and uppercase equivalent); difference between letters & others
  - [DONE] list of patterns
  - [DONE] list of exceptions
- that list should be auto-generated from TeX sources and used for [complete a list]:
  - hyphenator
  - ...
- LuaTeX patterns

Documentation:
- how to use patterns in plain TeX
- how to use patterns in LaTeX with polyglossia (or babel?)
- how to use patterns in ConTeXt
- how to add a new language (once we quit the project)

Testing:
- collect lists of words for the languages where that is possible (no copyright problems)
- write a luatex tester for a collection of words for each language

Licences:
- ... complete the list with tasks that need to be done
- we want two licences: one for content and one for packaging
- write a simple licence for packaging:
  - we don't care what others (outside of TeX world) do; just mention the credit to hyph-utf8
    and complete credit to pattern authors
  - respect the licence of pattern authors
  - within TeX world:
    - keep the functionality; implementation may change, but not the end result (unless improved)
    - contact the list first when changes are needed
    - if team disappears, one should be free to continue the work (mention how that should be done)
    - some general guidelines:
      - no TeX commands (apart from \hyphenation and \patterns)
      - everything in Unicode
      - hyph-xx.tex will keep containing the patterns
      - loadhyph-xx.tex will keep loading the patterns, but may change considerably (ugly tricks should go there)
      - ... (complete the list)
    - language-specific:
      - author of existing patterns has full right to submit changes
      - when a new author comes and the old one doesn't respond ... what to do?
      - when two version of patterns appear, try to convince the authors to combine the patterns
        ... write some general guidelines
- collect a few ideas for valid licences (maybe a different licence f)
- write the authors if they agree with that licence (give them a few options to choose from)
- write some really nice, easily parsable form and apply to all the patterns
- modify generating scripts for:
  - German
  - gl
  - eu, tk, tr

Collaboration:
- make a list of people that we would want to collaborate with
- some notification system for those using our patterns as source for whenever something in repository changes
- write done for everyone we have collaborated with

TeX users:
- [on the way] write DOC about pattern conversion
- create a web page
- write an article for TUG boat and/or other TeX magazines
- [on the way] maybe present the main idea at some TUG conference
- notify mailing lists
- CTAN people should take care for new patterns to be submitted in the proper form

Software:
- possibly rewrite patgen to handle UTF-8 (ask the author of javascript)

Some other changes:
- [half done by Norbert] unify pattern loading with both plain TeX/LaTeX
- there is now language.dat + xxhyph.tex - one will be redundant
  (get rid of it once all the patterns are converted)
