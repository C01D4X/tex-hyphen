This is a list of things that needs to be done to propagate the changes properly.
Write DONE to each issue once resolved.

TeX Distributions:
- [DONE] propagate changes into TeX Live
- [DONE] coordinate with Christian Schenk <cs@miktex.org> for changes in MikTeX
- [DONE] coordinate with Akira Kakuto <kakuto@fsci.fuk.kindai.ac.jp> for changes in W32TeX

Pattern creators:
- make a list of pattern authors, notify them about changes,
  explain them that they need to modify UTF-8 file/submit file it as UTF-8 in future
- write DONE for each language once you receive the answer from the author

Languages:
- unification of Mongolian
- do something with EO
- Russian etc. that are still outsourcing
- versioning: German etc.
- Norwegian
- Indic

CTAN:
- move old patterns to obsolete
- [DONE] upload new patterns
- make an easy-to-browse structure
- ask CTAN people to be careful if someone uploads new patterns
- write auto-notificator for changes in CTAN

OpenOffice:
- write auto-notificator for changes in OOo (more important)
- contact the authors & join the efforts
- import indic scripts

Impromevents:
- prepare a better version of notes
- auto-conversion into four different files:
  - licence
  - list of used letters for each language (lowercase and uppercase equivalent)
  - list of patterns
  - list of exceptions
- that list should be auto-generated from TeX sources and used for [complete a list]:
  - hyphenator
  - ...
- LuaTeX patterns

Collaboration:
- make a list of people that we would want to collaborate with
- write done for everyone we have collaborated with

TeX users:
- [on the way] write DOC about pattern conversion
- create a web page
- write an article for TUG boat and/or other TeX magazines
- [on the way] maybe present the main idea at some TUG conference
- notify mailing lists
- CTAN people should take care for new patterns to be submitted in the proper form

Software:
- possibly rewrite patgen to handle UTF-8 (ask the author of javascript)

Some other changes:
- [half done by Norbert] unify pattern loading with both plain TeX/LaTeX
- there is now language.dat + xxhyph.tex - one will be redundant
  (get rid of it once all the patterns are converted)
