*Concise guide to test-patterns.tex*

test-patterns.tex is an attempt to provide routines to test visually
hyphenation patterns.  It uses LuaTeX callbacks to do the main job, and
Lua functions to test the output, so it will only work with the LuaTeX
TeX engine.

In order for patterns to be used correctly, it is necessary to use a
font that supports all the characters used by the languages at hand
(which is the same limitation as the original TeX engine).  Otherwise
some characters might be lost, and the results would be meaningless.

The pattern testing functions honor \lefthyphenmin and \righthyphenmin
(they will just use whatever value they happen to have at the time a
word is set).

The main functions are to be called from either TeX or Lua, while there
are usually equivalents in both languages:

\loadpatterns{<language tag>} loads the patterns for said language.

\comparehyphenation{<text>} takes a list of hyphenated words and breaks
them into words; then it computes the hyphenation points in each word
using the patterns that are active at the time and prints them to the
log file with a word on each line.

The invocation \comparehyphenation{thefirstword-inmytext
the-sec-ond-word-in-my-text} will thus output something like

the-first-word-in-my-text (thefirstword-inmytext)
the-se-cond-word-in-my-text (the-sec-ond-word-in-my-text)

I wrote this to compare the way our patterns hyphenated words with the
hyphenation points that are found in typeset documents.

test-patterns-sl.tex gives an example of using the internal Lua commands
to retrieve the list of hyphenated words in a Lua table.

The implementation, and in particular the names of the functions, is a
confusing mess in all respects and should be changed, but at the moment
I have to focus on other projects and wouldn't like to spend too much
time on it.
