# TODO: add a function to generate patterns for Ottoman Turkish

# open file for writing the patterns
$tr = File.new("hyph-tr.tex", "w")
# in TDS
$tr = File.new("../../../../../tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/hyph-tr.tex", "w")

def add_comment(str)
	$tr.puts "% " + str.gsub(/\n/, "\n% ").gsub(/% \n/, "%\n")
end

# The patterns (and algorithm for generating them) were first meant
# for supporting Ottoman Turkish, but adapted for modern Turkish later.
# Turkish alphabet includes some special vowels (ıiöü) and consonants (çğş),
# but the patterns also support another three vowels (âîû):
# - a with circumflex is a necessity, it must be supported
# - ı and u with circumflex could be there, not as pressing as "a" but still
# Some letters such as z, k, s or t represent multiple letters in the old
# alphabet, so some transcriptions from Ottoman to Turkish use some accents on
# these for phonetic reasons, but there is no need to support them.
# 
# Comment posted by: H. Turgut Uyar <uyar at itu.edu.tr>

# define a class of vowels and consonants
vowels = %w{a â e ı i î o ö u ü û}
consonants = %w{b c ç d f g ğ h j k l m n p r s ş t v y z}
