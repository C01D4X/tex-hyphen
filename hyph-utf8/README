This is the central repository for all hyphenation patterns (that we know of).
These patterns are encoded in UTF-8, but can also be used with 8-bit TeX
engines such as pdfTeX with the help of mechanisms provided with the package.

If you are an author of hyphenation patterns and want to add or update them,
please contact the maintainers through the mailing list: tex-hyphen@tug.org
You can also visit the home page at http://www.hyphenation.org for more
information and technical details.
