A non-empty PDF file that describes the {\tt hyph-utf8} package with at least two sentences.

\blank[3*big]

The {\tt hyph-utf8} package gathers all the existing hyphenation patterns for
\TEX, converted to UTF-8.  They can be used directly by UTF-8-aware \TEX{}
engines such as \LUATEX{} and \XETEX, and there is a mechanism to convert the
patterns to some 8-bit encoding when used with \PDFTEX{} or Knuth's \TEX.
