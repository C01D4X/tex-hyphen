This utility consists of two parts.

Part 1 converts languages.rb to languages.xml. It consists of
ConvertLanguageData.java, LanguageDataParser.java,
ConvertLanguageData.xsl, codemapping.xml. Invocation:

java org.tug.texhyphen.util.ConvertLanguageData path/to/languages.rb

output: languages.xml, in the same directory as languages.rb.

The file codemapping contains the mapping from tex-code to
fop-code. If this file has an entry with non-empty fop-code, it is
inserted in languages.xml as attribute fop-code. If this file has an
entry with empty fop-code, that language gets no attribute
fop-code. Otherwise, that language gets attribute fop-code with the
same value as tex-code (attribute code).

The current file languages.xml was modified manually after conversion,
to add the three languages at the bottom of the file.

Part 2 converts tex pattern files to fop pattern files. It consists of
ConvertTeXPattern.java, TeXPatternParser.java, ConvertTeXPattern.xsl,
languages.xml. Invocation:

java org.tug.texhyphen.util.ConvertTeXPattern [--uselanguagedata]
[--texcodes code1,code2,...] infileuri1 [infileuri2 ...] outfile

infileuri must be a file or http URI. With a file URI, it may also be
a directory; in that case all pattern files in that directory are
converted. outfile must be a path to an output filename or
directory. If there are more input files, it must be an output
directory. Option 'uselanguagedata' converts all input files which
represent a language in the languages file with a fop-code. Option
'--texcodes code1,code2,...' converts only those input files which
represent a language with one of the given tex codes. Without those
options all input files are converted. In any case, only files are
converted which represent a language in the languages file with a
fop-code.
