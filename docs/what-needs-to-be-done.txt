From Mojca/Arthur:

When a new language is added:
- modify languages.rb to add a new entry
- run all the other steps for "when patterns change":
  - ./generate-pattern-loaders.rb
  - ./generate-plain-patterns.rb
  - ./generate-tl-files.rb
  - (./generate-ptex-patterns.rb - not used yet)
  - (./generate-webpage.rb - not used at the moment)
  - run other scripts in "collaboration" folder
- and then:
  - add new tlpsrc to TeX Live (tlpsrc file + add that package to collection-langsomething)

When a new encoding is added (or an encoding is modified):
- run ./generate-converters.rb -> generates conv-utf8-foo.tex

When some language is added or there is some major rewrite or problem with pattern loaders:
- run ./generate-pattern-loaders.rb

When patterns change (minor changes):
- ./generate-plain-patterns.rb
- (./generate-ptex-patterns.rb - not used yet)
- run other scripts in "collaboration" folder

When needed (user-visible change):
- add an entry to CHANGES

At any time:
- try to add some more documentation
