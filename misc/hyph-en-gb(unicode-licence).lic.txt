% Dominik Wujastyk and myself (Philip Taylor), it has been agreed that the version uploaded

% Version 1.0a.  Released 18th October 2005/PT.
%
% Created by Dominik Wujastyk and Graham Toal using Frank Liang's PATGEN 1.0.
% Like the US patterns, these UK patterns correctly hyphenate about 90% of
% the words in the input list, and produce no hyphens not in the list
% (see TeXbook pp. 451--2).
%
% These patterns are based on a file of 114925 British-hyphenated words
% generously made available to Dominik Wujastyk by Oxford University Press.
% This list of words is copyright to the OUP and may not be redistributed.
% The hyphenation break points in the words in the abovementioned file is
% also copyright to the OUP.
%
% We are very grateful to Oxford University Press for allowing us to use
% their list of hyphenated words to produce the following TeX hyphenation
% patterns.  This file of hyphenation patterns may be freely distributed.
%
% These patterns require a value of about 14000 for TeX's pattern memory size.
