shortdesc Esperanto Hyphenation Patterns
longdesc Hyphenation patterns for Esperanto language in UTF-8 and ISO Latin 3 (IL3) encoding.
longdesc Note that TeX distributions usually don't ship any suitable fonts in that encoding,
longdesc so unless you create your own font support or want to use MlTeX,
longdesc using native UTF-8 engines is highly recommended.
