shortdesc Russian hyphenation patterns
longdesc Hyphenation patterns for Russian in T2A and UTF-8 encoding.
longdesc For 8-bit TeX engines, the ruhyphen package provides a number of different pattern sets,
longdesc as well as different (8-bit) encodings, that can be chosen at format-generation time.
longdesc The UTF-8 version only provides the default pattern set.  A mechanism similar
longdesc to the one used for 8-bit patterns may be implemented in the future.
